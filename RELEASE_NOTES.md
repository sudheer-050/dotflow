# Dotflow 0.7.0

Windows x64, English-only, offline speech after initial setup download.

- PDF-only conversation export with readable scope previews and explicit participant-label wording. Original words remain read-only; external PDF copies are not tamper-proof.
- Responsive export, playback, storage and backup interfaces; separate retention and deleted-record recovery.
- Saved-record review separated from new recording controls; actual saved audio sources only, device/activity feedback and grouped actions.
- Apply/Cancel for device changes; permanent toolbar hiding and snooze respected across note actions.
- Compact Home, contextual recovery, consistent Dotflow branding, improved themed tabs/dropdowns, searchable word/snippet forms and explicit correction saving.
- Standard, Chat, Email and conservative Code styles; user-controlled Practice and guided first-use checks.

Verification: 84 automated checks passed, four live checks excluded. Isolated UI checks preserve original words and preferences. See FIX_REPORT_0.7.0.md for all 38 review findings and remaining acceptance work.

The installer is unsigned because no code-signing certificate was provided. This session built the package locally; it did not install or publish it. Real microphone/call capture, browser/terminal injection, mixed-DPI pointer behavior, Narrator and consented speech-accuracy comparison require a normal desktop session. The managed session denies those operations. No macOS/mobile/cloud sync release is included.
